#!/bin/bash

# Set the filename and path of the source file
source_file="/var/log/syslog"

# Set the filename and path of the destination file
date_time=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S')
destination_file="./syslog_${date_time}.log"

# Copy the source file to the destination file
cp "${source_file}" "${destination_file}"

So this script basically creates a backup of the /var/log/syslog file and saves it to the current directory with a filename that includes the current date and time. This can be useful for keeping track of system logs over time and for diagnosing issues that might occur.
